# Binary metamorphosis

This application converts any executable file (ie. <kbd>.exe</kbd> or any type of file in fact) to VBA source code which can be included as a <kbd>.bas</kbd> module in an EXCEL file. Once inserted into the EXCEL file, the VBA source code can be used to completely restore the executable file to disk in the same directory as the EXCEL file. Obviously, a different path can also be used. Also, once recomposed on disk, the executable file can be executed automatically by using VBA. Please use the EXCEL file in the <kbd>test</kbd> directory for testing. Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA window so you can see the code being discussed.
